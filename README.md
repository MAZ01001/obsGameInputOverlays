Free overlays for the Input Overlay OBS plugin.

## What

[Input Overlay](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/input-overlay.552/) is a free [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) plugin to show controller input while gaming and stuff.

To be clear, I'm not the author of the plugin.

## How

The files (for each game) you need are the layout image ("layers_table.png") and the layout config file ("overlay.json").

Store these two files somewhere OBS can see them, and then in OBS, add an "InputOverlay" and add these two files to it, done.

To modify keybindings, put both files in the [official input overlay online editor](https://univrsal.github.io/input-overlay/cct/)
and click on an image and select "Edit selected element" on the right.

You might need to move the canvas with one right click and stop moving with one left click to see the image.
Because these are HQ images and zooming out is not enough.

Then on the left, there is an input field labeled "Keycode" where you input your key
(the site should detect any button press and update this field) to apply hit OK.

When you're ready, select "Export to JSON" and now that's your new layout config file ("overlay.json") with your custom keybindings.

## Credits

If you use these overlays, I would appreciate it if you credit me / this page as I did draw the images and did the layout myself (with the online editor),
but it's not necessary.

Also, see [the GitHub page for the Input-Overlay plugin](https://github.com/univrsal/input-overlay).

Again, I'm not the author of the plugin.
